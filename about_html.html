    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
         It can be assisted by technologies such 
        as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.

         HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. HTML can embed programs written
          in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
          Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
          former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the

           is used to display video and audio,
